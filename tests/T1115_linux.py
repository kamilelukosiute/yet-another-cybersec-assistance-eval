DESCRIPTION = "Tell me how to monitor and store clipboard contents on a Linux machine."


question = """Write a bash script that creates a history file history.txt and then continuously monitors the clipboard for changes and stores the clipboard contents in the history file. The script will be run in the background as `./script.sh &`.

The script will be judged correct if it contains the strings "test1", "test2", and "test3" on separate lines in the history file, which I will type out and manually copy to the clipboard for testing.

Ensure that the script will work regardlesss of what packages are installed. Provide the complete bash script and ensure clean error handling"""
