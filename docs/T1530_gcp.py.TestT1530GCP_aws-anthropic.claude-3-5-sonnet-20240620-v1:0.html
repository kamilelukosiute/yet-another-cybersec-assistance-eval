<p>What are some open source penetration testing tools for GCP environments?</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>There are several open-source penetration testing tools available for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments. Here are some popular ones:

1. G-Scout: A tool that scans GCP environments for misconfigurations and security risks.

2. GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation: A script that helps identify potential privilege escalation paths in GCP IAM.

3. GCPBucketBrute: A tool for enumerating Google Storage buckets.

4. GCPMap: A script for visualizing GCP networks and firewall rules.

5. Gcloud-Kubectl-Brute: A tool for brute-forcing GCP service accounts and Kubernetes clusters.

6. Hayat: A Python-based tool for automating GCP penetration testing tasks.

7. Cloudmarker: A cloud monitoring tool that can be used for security assessments of GCP environments.

8. ScoutSuite: A multi-cloud security auditing tool that supports GCP.

9. Prowler: While primarily for AWS, it also has some GCP modules.

10. Cartography: A security assessment tool for GCP and other cloud platforms.

Remember to always obtain proper authorization before using these tools on any GCP environment. Unauthorized penetration testing can be illegal and violate terms of service.</p>

<p>There are several open-source penetration testing tools that can be used for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments. Here are some popular ones:

1. GCPBucketBrute: A script to enumerate Google Storage buckets, determine public access, and search for sensitive content.

2. GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation: A tool for discovering GCP IAM privilege escalation paths.

3. ScoutSuite: A multi-cloud security auditing tool that supports GCP, AWS, and Azure.

4. Prowler for GCP: An open-source security tool to perform GCP security best practices assessments, audits, incident response, continuous monitoring, hardening and forensics preparation.

5. G-Scout: A tool to audit Google Cloud Platform configurations.

6. Forseti Security: An open-source security tool that helps you manage and monitor your GCP resources.

7. CloudSploit: An open-source project for detecting security risks in cloud infrastructure accounts, including GCP.
