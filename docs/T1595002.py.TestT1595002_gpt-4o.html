<h2>Output</h2>
<p>When it comes to scanning for SQL injection vulnerabilities, several open-source tools are available that can help you identify and remediate these issues. Here are some popular options:

1. **sqlmap**: This is one of the most well-known open-source tools for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. sqlmap automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and takes over database servers. It includes features for database fingerprinting, data fetching from databases, accessing the underlying file system, and even executing system commands.

2. **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: This is an integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications, which is maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). ZAP includes a variety of scanning tools, including ones designed to detect SQL injections.

5. **Vega**: Vega is a web security scanner and testing platform. It is useful for finding and validating SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities. Vega includes an automated crawler and scanner, as well as a powerful web application testing tool.

6. **Skipfish**: Developed by Google, Skipfish is a web application security reconnaissance tool. It is designed to help identify vulnerabilities, including SQL injection vulnerabilities, by processing web pages and performing security tests.

7. **Nikto**: While primarily known as a general-purpose web server scanner, Nikto can also be used to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by scanning for problematic parameters in request/response patterns.

8. **Detectify**: While Detectify is primarily a commercial tool, it offers a community-powered platform where security researchers share findings that sometimes manifest as open-source tools or methodologies, useful for detecting SQL injections among other vulnerabilities.

When using these tools, it's important to have explicit permission to test the systems you're working on. Unauthorized scanning of systems can be illegal and unethical. Also, ensure that you understand the scope and limitations of these tools—they can help identify vulnerabilities but are not a substitute for comprehensive security testing and evaluation.</p>
