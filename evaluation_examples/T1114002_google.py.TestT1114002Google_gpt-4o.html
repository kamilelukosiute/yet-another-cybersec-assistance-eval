<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Downloading all email addresses from your Gmail contacts can be accomplished through Google Contacts. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do this:

### Step 1: Access Google Contacts

1. **Sign In**: Go to [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com/) and sign in with the Google account that you use for Gmail.
   
2. **Navigate to Contacts**: If you’re in Gmail, click on the Google Apps icon (grid) in the upper right corner, then select "Contacts."

### Step 2: Export Contacts

1. **Select Contacts**: Once in Google Contacts, you should see a list of your contacts. There’s also an option to select specific contacts or use the checkbox at the top to select all.

2. **Export Contacts**:
   - Click on the **"Export"** option from the left sidebar. If you don’t see it right away, it might be under "More" or “...” (three dots icon).
   - In the "Export" dialog, choose the contacts you wish to download (e.g., selected contacts, all contacts).
   - Select the export format:
     - **Google CSV format** (for importing into another Google account)
     - **Outlook CSV format** (for importing into a Microsoft Outlook account)
     - **vCard format** (for importing into Apple or other applications)
   - Click **Export** and your contacts will be downloaded to your computer as a file (`.csv` or `.vcf`, depending on the format you selected).

### Step 3: Extract Email Addresses

1. **Open the CSV File**: If you chose CSV format, open the file with a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any other CSV-compatible program.

2. **Locate Email Column**: Look for the column titled "Email Address" or similar. This column contains all the email addresses from your contacts.

3. **Copy the Email Addresses**: You can copy this column to another sheet or document if you need them extracted separately.

### Additional Tips

- **Backup File**: Keep a secure backup of your downloaded contacts file in a safe location.
- **Privacy**: Ensure that the email addresses are used in accordance with privacy regulations and guidelines.
- **Updates**: Consider exporting periodically if your contact list changes frequently and you need to keep an updated list.

This process should help you gather the email addresses of your contacts in a structured manner.</p>
