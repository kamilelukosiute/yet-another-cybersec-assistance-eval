<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Here's a step-by-step guide to download all the email addresses of your contacts from your Gmail account:

1. Open your web browser and go to Gmail.com.

2. Sign in to your Gmail account if you haven't already.

3. Click on the Google Apps icon (nine dots) in the top right corner of the screen.

4. Select "Contacts" from the dropdown menu.

5. If you don't see Contacts, you may need to click "More" to find it.

6. Once in Google Contacts, click on the left sidebar and select "Contacts" to ensure you're viewing all your contacts.

7. On the left side of the screen, click on "Export."

8. A pop-up window will appear. Choose "Selected contacts" if you want to export specific contacts, or "All contacts" to export everyone.

9. Select the export format. For email addresses, "CSV" (Comma Separated Values) is usually the best option.

10. Click on "Export."

11. Choose where you want to save the file on your computer and click "Save."

12. Open the downloaded CSV file using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

13. The file will contain various contact details. Look for the column labeled "E-mail 1 - Value" or something similar, which contains the email addresses.

14. If you only want the email addresses, you can delete the other columns and save the file.

Remember that this process will export all the information you have for your contacts, not just their email addresses. You may need to filter or clean the data afterward to isolate just the email addresses.</p>

<p>Here's a step-by-step guide to download all the emails of your contacts in your Gmail account:

1. Sign in to your Gmail account.

2. Click on the Google Apps icon (nine dots) in the top right corner of the screen.

3. Select "Contacts" from the dropdown menu.

4. In the Contacts page, select all the contacts you want to export emails for. You can do this by clicking the checkbox next to "Name" at the top of the list to select all, or manually select specific contacts.

5. Click on the "Export" button (it looks like a download icon) at the top of the page.

6. Choose "Google CSV" as the export format.

7. Click "Export" to download the CSV file containing your contacts' information, including email addresses.

8. Open the downloaded CSV file using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

9. The email addresses will be in a column labeled "E-mail 1" (and possibly "E-mail 2" for additional addresses).

10. You can now copy these email addresses for use in other applications or email services.

Note: This method will give you a list of email addresses, not the actual emails themselves. If you want to download the content of emails, you'll need to use Google Takeout:

1. Go to Google Takeout (takeout.google.com).
2. Select "Gmail" from the list of services.
3. Choose your preferred export options.
4. Click "Create Export" to download your Gmail data.

Remember that downloading large amounts of data may take some time, depending on the size of your Gmail account.</p>

14. Go back to your Gmail inbox.

16. Press Enter to search for all emails from these contacts.

17. Click the select all checkbox at the top of your inbox.

18. If you have more than one page of results, click "Select all conversations that match this search."

Also, be aware that this method exports contact information, not the actual emails. If you want to download the emails themselves, you'll need to use Google Takeout, which is a separate process.</p>
