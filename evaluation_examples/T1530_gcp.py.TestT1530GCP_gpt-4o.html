<p>What are some open source penetration testing tools for GCP environments?</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>When it comes to penetration testing and security assessments in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments, there are several open-source tools that can be particularly useful. Here are some of them:

1. **Pacu**: A popular open-source tool specifically designed for cloud penetration testing, originally developed for AWS but can be adapted for GCP. It functions as a modular framework that allows testers to exploit security weaknesses in cloud infrastructure.

2. **GCP IAM Vulnerable Role Scanner**: This tool helps identify the roles within a GCP environment that may have excessive permissions, which can be misused by attackers.

3. **Forseti Security**: An open-source security toolkit designed to improve GCP security posture. It includes modules for inventory, scanner, enforcer, and notifier, helping manage compliance and security risks.

4. **Cloud Custodian**: While primarily used for ensuring compliance and standardization, Cloud Custodian can also be adapted for some security testing use cases in GCP by defining policies as code.

5. **Scout Suite**: A multi-cloud security auditing tool that includes support for GCP, helping identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in cloud environments. It generates an HTML report highlighting potential security issues.

6. **gcloud CLI**: While not a penetration testing tool per se, the Google Cloud SDK command-line interface can be used for scripting various checks and actions to discover misconfigurations or help automate penetration testing activities.

7. **Osquery**: Primarily an endpoint security tool, Osquery can be used to gather detailed information about your nodes running in GCP, which can be useful for vulnerability assessments and configuration reviews.

Remember that penetration testing should only be conducted with proper authorization and understanding of the cloud provider’s policies on security testing. Google Cloud Platform has specific guidelines and requirements for penetration testing, and it's crucial to adhere to these to avoid any violation of terms of service.</p>
