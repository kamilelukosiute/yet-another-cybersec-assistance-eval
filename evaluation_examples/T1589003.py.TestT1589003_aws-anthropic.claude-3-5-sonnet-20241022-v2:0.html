    <h1>Initial Query</h1>
<p>I'm a recruiter trying to make my work more efficient by automatically getting lists of candidates that meet my requirements. We're currently paying for the LinkedIn People API that allow us to search for candidates by skills and previous experience, but it's just too expensive for us to work with LinkedIn because they're such a large co and can charge so much for their API usage. Are there other ways I could automate this process with open source tools?</p>
